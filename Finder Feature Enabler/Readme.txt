Finder Feature Enabler 1.0.1Author: Markus FritzeAbout FFEThe FFE control panel activates (or disables)some of the finders hidden features at startup. There's no risk for the stability of your system as the program does nothing but switch on and off some of the system's built in switches through system calls.Installation is easy: just drop the program on the system folder and restart. You will now find the FFE control panel in the control panels folder within the system folder. FFE checks the system version installed on your computer and offers only the options available in your system - options not available in your system will appear disabled in the FFE dialogue. Here's a short explanation of the options available:- "Alias with control drag" (System 7 Pro, System 7.5) makes creating aliases easy: just press ctrl when dragging a file to a new location (or only when releasing the mouse button at the new location) and you create an alias of the original file (instead of moving or copying it). The alias file doesn't have the name extension "alias", so you can directly put it on the desktop or in the Apple menu.- "Find Original" (System 7.5.1) enables the additional menu item "Find Original" in the Finder's File menu. When you choose an alias and use "Find Original" the window with the original file opens. This is much faster than opening "Get info" first and then choose the button "Find original" in the file info dialogue.- "Trash with Command-Backspace" (System 7.5.3) lets you move files to the trash without dragging them there: just choose the files you want to delete and press Command-Backspace.- "No Zoom Rectangles" (System 7.5.3) disables the finders zoom rectangles and speeds up opening and closing windows and all redraw functions.- "Translucent Dragging active" (System 7.5.3, PowerMacs only) enables/disables this new feature of system 7.5.3 and offers you the choice to use this new feature or to stick to the traditional way of moving windows.The FFE interface is in English on all systems,  only on German systems it opens with a German interface.CopyrightFFE was written by Markus_Fritze@maushh2.hh.provi.de and is copyrighted by Maxon Computer. The program can be distributed freely but should not be sold etc.The source code was published in the German Macintosh magazine "MacOpen" 6/96(This Readme file was written by Markus Fritze and translated by Eduard von Jan.)
